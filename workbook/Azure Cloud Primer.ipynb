    "### Why Cloud?\n",
    "- **On-Premise/Local vs Cloud**\n",
    "    - On-Premise/Local is more expensive with upfront costs (i.e RAM, GPU, etc)\n",
    "- **RAM vs CPU vs GPU for VM instances**\n",
    "    - RAM for reading in data directly into memory (pandas dataframes)\n",
    "    - CPU is not entirely important, but you want a decent one in general for parsing data. A good CPU will support mutliprocessing better\n",
    "    - GPU is important for model training / deep learning \n",
    "    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes\n",
    "- **Industry standards**\n",
    "    - Cloud tech is now the new industry norm for ETL, Databricks, Web Apps, Cloud Computing etc. \n",
    "    - Much more secure (up to certain classification of data), accessible (by your team) and scalable\n",
    "    - Vertically scale up (more resources / compute power / memory capacity). You can think of it as an apartment which needs to accomodate tenants. When more tenants come in, you need to vertically scale your resources.\n",
    "    - Horizontally scale up (multiple servers / clusters). You can think of it as a highway which needs to give access between cities. The more tenants you have = more cars on the highway. Eventually, your two-lane highway might need to expand to 8-lanes in order to remain more efficient\n",
    "- **Automation**\n",
    "    - Cloud offers batch jobs that can be run at scheduled times\n",
    "    - Pipelines can be made to run and deploy code every commit / pull request"
